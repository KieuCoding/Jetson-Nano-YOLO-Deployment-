What my program does: It access your computers' webcam or external cam if avaliable then performs live object detection on your Jetson Nano
Extra feature: Press spacebar to manually take a picture on the camera
Fun little ideas: You can definitely modify the program to take pictures if a certain object is detected, Or add in GPIO functions into the program to make certain hardware components react if detecting a particular object
